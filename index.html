            This research includes the evaluation of openings in different rating ranges and openings from chess.com.
            the research's aim is to get the hang of tension by the end of the opening fazes in chess.
            I gave 1 or 2 tension points to each player based on the criteria.
            Then I evaluated the percentages of each opening and rating range.
            I hope you enjoy this informative page because this took me a lot of time :) .
            The criteria used throughout this research is provided below:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>For each one of 4 center squares controlled: +2</li>
            <li>For each piece developed from its starting position: +1</li>
            <li>For castling: +2</li>
            <li>For each possible (no further than 1 move after) or present attack: +1</li>
            <li>For each pin (pin would count only if there is a possibility of opponent moving away that piece which would result in material loss, unless that piece already interacts with the attacking piece): +2</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>general facts:</h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Games where all of the center squares where controlled: ~49%</li>
            <li>Games where only one side castled: ~32%</li>
            <li>Both sides castled in ~7% of total games.
            (Therefore neither side castled in ~61% of games included in the study)</li>
            <li>At least 1 pin was present in ~27% of games.</li>
            <li>Games where 6 or more pieces were developed was ~29%</li>
            <li>At least 2 attacks present: 16%</li>
            <li>Average combined tension points for each game: 13.79</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Opening analysis:</h3>
    <h2>1. The most castling:</h2>
    <b>e4 g6</b>
    <p>One of the easiest to explain. g6 invites the idea to castle for black which is visible when looked at stats.</p>
    <p>At least one side castled: 100%</p>
    <p>Both sides castled: 33.3%</p>
    <h2>2. The most center control:</h2>
    <b>c4 Nf6</b>
    <p>Since this is 100-800 range it is really hard to explain this stat since neither side really asserts dominance on central squares in first moves</p>
    <h2>3. The most attacks:</h2>
    <b>e4 d6</b>
    <p>Pirc opening opens up endless opportunities for players to start attacks. This is evident in stats.</p>
    <p>Average attack points for each game: 1.5</p>
    <p>Maximum amount of attacks observed in 1 game: 4</p>
    <h2>4. The most pins:</h2>
    <b>Nf3 g6</b>
    <p>Since g6 opens up a square for a bishop it is really easy to get a pin diagonally. White has many opportunities for pins as well.</p>
    <p>Average amount of pins: 1</p>
    <h2>5. Highest average amount of developed pieces:</h2>
    <b>Nf3 c5</b>
    <p>Both starting moves start the game more passively, giving eachother space. This is crucial in piece development</p>
    <p>Average amount of developed pieces: 6.5</p>
    <p>Maximum observed: 9</p>
    <h2>6. Highest average of combined tension:</h2>
    <b>e4 g6</b>
    <p>Since g6 opens up a square for a bishop, it is really easy to gain control of the center. White sets up aggresively by playing e4.</p>
    <p>Average combined tension: 15.83</p>
    <p>Maximum observed: 19</p>

            <li>Average combined tension points for each game: 14.6</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Opening analysis:</h3>
    <h2>1. The most castling:</h2>
    <b>e4 d6</b>
    <p>d6 is one of the more passive responses for e4, which opens opportunities for castling.</p>
    <p>At least one side castled: 100%</p>
    <p>Both sides castled: 50%</p>
    <h2>2. The most center control:</h2>
    <b>c4 Nf6</b>
    <p>Since this is 800-1300 range it is really hard to explain this stat since neither side really asserts dominance on central squares in first moves</p>
    <h2>3. The most attacks:</h2>
    <b>e4 d5</b>
    <p>scandinavian is always chaotic, especially in lower ratings</p>
    <p>Average attack points for each game: 1.33</p>
    <p>Maximum amount of attacks observed in 1 game: 3</p>
    <h2>4. The most pins:</h2>
    <b>c4 e5</b>
    <p>the knight that comes on c3 gets pinned a lot.</p>
    <p>Average amount of pins: 1.33</p>
    <h2>5. Highest average amount of developed pieces:</h2>
    <b>d4 e6</b>
    <p>Both starting moves start the game more passively, giving eachother space. This is crucial in piece development</p>
    <p>Average amount of developed pieces: 6.67</p>
    <p>Maximum observed: 9</p>
    <h2>6. Highest average of combined tension:</h2>
    <b>c4 e5</b>
    <p>c4 e5 is usually more aggressive as players improve. It allows making a lot of pins, attacks are a lot easier to plan.</p>
    <p>Average combined tension: 19.33</p>
    <p>Maximum observed: 20</p>

            <li>Average combined tension points for each game: 16.28</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Opening analysis:</h3>
    <h2>1. The most castling:</h2>
    <b>e4 e6</b>
    <p>positionally stable development: both sides finish minor-piece development before launching major pawn breaks, so castling becomes a natural safety step for both sides.</p>
    <p>At least one side castled: 100%</p>
    <p>Both sides castled: 66.7%</p>
    <h2>2. The most center control:</h2>
    <b>e4 d6</b>
    <p>Black often follows up with e5 which closes up the position and gives both white and black 2 center squares to control each.</p>
    <p>Average amount of center squares controlled: 3.84</p>
    <h2>3. The most attacks:</h2>
    <b>Nf3 d5</b>
    <p>produces very direct tension in the center from move 1-2; early confrontation (pawns and minor pieces) opens files/diagonals quickly. That early tension often creates tactical motifs.</p>
    <p>Average attack points for each game: 1.67</p>
    <p>Maximum amount of attacks observed in 1 game: 5</p>
    <h2>4. The most pins:</h2>
    <b>e4 e6</b>
    <p>Closed or semi-closed French pawn structures make tactical tools like pins especially useful. The rating range is already good enough to detect that.</p>
    <p>Average amount of pins: 1</p>
    <h2>5. Highest average amount of developed pieces:</h2>
    <b>Nf3 c5</b>
    <p>White often develops several minor pieces quickly (Nc3, Bc4/Bb5, O-O), and Black responds actively (…Nc6, …g6, …Bg7, …O-O), so developed pieces rise in numbers.</p>
    <p>Average amount of developed pieces: 8</p>
    <p>Maximum observed: 9</p>
    <h2>6. Highest average of combined tension:</h2>
    <b>Nf3 c5</b>
    <p>Sicilian’s imbalance also produces middlegame positions rich in tactical and positional features (weak squares, pawn breaks, piece activity), which raises the combined score</p>
    <p>Average combined tension: 19.67</p>
    <p>Maximum observed: 24</p>

    </p>
    <h3>Opening analysis:</h3>
    <h2>1. The most castling:</h2>
    <b>e4 d6</b>
    <p>e4 d6 often leads to positions where White completes normal development and castles kingside early, while Black sometimes delays or avoids castling depending on counterplay.</p>
    <p>At least one side castled: 100%</p>
    <p>Both sides castled: 16.67%</p>
    <h2>2. The most center control:</h2>
    <b>d4 d5</b>
    <p>d4 d5 is almost never agressive and they generally tend to stay in place unless a gambit is played.</p>
    <p>Average amount of center squares controlled: 4</p>
    <h2>3. The most attacks:</h2>
    <b>Nf3 d5</b>

    <h2>4. The most pins:</h2>
    <b>Nf3 d5</b>
    <p>The same Nf3 d5 positions that foster attacks also create typical pin motifs</p>
    <p>Average amount of pins: 1.33</p>
    <h2>5. Highest average amount of developed pieces:</h2>
    <b>c4 c5</b>
    <p>c4 c5 commonly leads to symmetrical English/Sicilian-style structures where both sides mobilize knights and bishops early and complete piece development quickly.</p>
    <p>Average amount of developed pieces: 8.33</p>
    <p>Maximum observed: 9</p>
    <h2>6. Highest average of combined tension:</h2>

        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Opening analysis:</h3>
    <h2>1. The most castling:</h2>
    <b>e4 e5</b>
    <p>You’ll often see both sides complete normal development and castle quickly; where only one side castles it’s usually a deliberate strategic choice (keeping the king in the center only if there’s concrete counterplay).</p>
    <p>At least one side castled: 100%</p>
    <p>Both sides castled: 50%</p>
    <h2>2. The most center control:</h2>
    <b>c4 c5</b>
    <p>Strong players playing English/Sicilian-like structures (c4 c5) are adept at transposing into highly contested central structures while using flank moves.</p>
    <p>Average amount of center squares controlled: 4</p>
    <h2>3. The most attacks:</h2>
    <b>e4 Nf6</b>
    <p>Lines with early …Nf6 (Alekhine/other counters) create asymmetry and concrete targets — high-rated players exploit these imbalances to create early tactical play.</p>
    <p>Average attack points for each game: 1</p>
    <p>Maximum amount of attacks observed in 1 game: 2</p>
    <h2>4. The most pins:</h2>
    <b>e4 e5</b>
    <p>Classical e4 e5 structures are rich in long-diagonal and bishop-pin motifs.</p>
    <p>Average amount of pins: 1.83</p>
    <h2>5. Highest average amount of developed pieces:</h2>
    <b>Nf3 Nf6</b>
    <p>Symmetrical knight-deployment lines (Nf3 Nf6) reach mature development quickly at higher levels — both players finish minor-piece development and only then decide on pawn breaks/transpositions.</p>
    <p>Average amount of developed pieces: 8.67</p>
    <p>Maximum observed: 9</p>
    <h2>6. Highest average of combined tension:</h2>
    <b>e4 e5</b>
    <p>In high-level e4–e5 games both sides execute principled development and produce middlegames with balanced activity and tactical opportunities.</p>

            <li>Average combined tension points for each game: 16.79</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Opening analysis:</h3>
    <h2>1. The most castling:</h2>
    <b>e4 d6</b>
    <p>In hypermodern structures like the Pirc/Modern Defense (e4 d6), castling is very common, especially for Black, as players prioritize king safety before central pawn breaks.</p>
    <p>At least one side castled: 100%</p>
    <p>Both sides castled: 83.33%</p>
    <h2>2. The most center control:</h2>
    <b>Nf3 d5</b>
    <p>Openings like the Reti/Queen’s Pawn setups allow both sides to occupy and contest the central squares early, producing idealized central control.</p>
    <p>Average amount of center squares controlled: 4</p>
    <h2>3. The most attacks:</h2>
    <b>Nf3 d5</b>
    <p>At a high level, flexible knight moves and open-systems often produce more tactical opportunities, which shows as a higher attacks average.</p>
    <p>Average attack points for each game: 1</p>
    <p>Maximum amount of attacks observed in 1 game: 2</p>
    <h2>4. The most pins:</h2>
    <b>e4 e5</b>
    <p>Classical e4 e5 structures are rich in long-diagonal and bishop-pin motifs.</p>
    <p>Average amount of pins: 1.33</p>
    <h2>5. Highest average amount of developed pieces:</h2>
    <b>Nf3 c5</b>
    <p>The position after 1.Nf3 c5 often transposes into English or Reversed Sicilian structures — both encourage gradual, harmonious piece development rather than early pawn clashes.</p>
    <p>Average amount of developed pieces: 8.33</p>
    <p>Maximum observed: 9</p>
    <h2>6. Highest average of combined tension:</h2>
    <b>Nf3 c5</b>
    <p>At 2400+ the English/Tatar/Azmatic transpositional and asymmetrical Sicilian-type play (Nf3–c5 family) often produces well-coordinated middlegames — reflected in a high combined average.</p>
    <p>Average combined tension: 20</p>
